If you choose not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to review some key points about HoloBox privacy practices:

Apps are photo editors that allow users to edit portraits with highly realistic facial transformations.

We do not use the Photos you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the editing functionality of the App.

We use third-party cloud providers — specifically Google Cloud Platform — to process and edit photos.

You only send to the cloud the Photos you specifically choose to edit.

Photos are temporarily stored on a cloud server during editing and encrypted with a key stored locally on your mobile device.

The photo will be deleted immediately after finishing the editing process.

Here's more information about our privacy practices.

If you have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, feel free to email me and I will definitely try to fix/help you.
